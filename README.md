# ðŸš— CarWorthPredictor
CarWorthPredictor is a machine learning-based web application built with Flask that predicts the price of a used car based on various input features such as brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and more.

The application takes user inputs, processes them, and outputs an estimated car price using trained ML models.

# ðŸ“Œ Features

User-friendly Web Interface with brand/model selection and input sliders.
Predicts used car prices dynamically based on multiple features.
Trained on cleaned and preprocessed dataset with all categorical values converted to numerical form.
Built using Jupyter Notebook for model training and Flask for deployment.

Multiple ML models tested and compared:

Linear Regression
XGBoost Regression
Random Forest Regression (Best Performing)

# ðŸ›  Tech Stack
